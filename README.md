# File-Handling

This Python program, 'file_handling.py', incorporates file handling to read data from an external text file named 'product_description.txt'. It then capitalizes the first letter of each word in the descriptions and saves the formatted data to a new text file named 'formatted_descriptions.txt'.

File Handling Steps:
1. Reads lines from 'product_descriptions.txt'.
2. Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the description.
3. Writes the new formatted lines to 'formatted_descriptions.txt'.

- Make sure to download the 'product_descriptions.txt' file and place it in the same directory as the program before running it.
- Check the newly created 'formatted_descriptions.txt' file for the capitalized product descriptions.
